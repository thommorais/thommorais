Hi, I'm Thom,
a front-end developer with a passion for building intuitive and user-friendly web and mobile applications. Currently, I am working at Fuerza studio, where I am able to apply my skills and knowledge to a variety of projects.

My skillset includes React, React Native, Three.js, Electron, and more. I'm also currently learning about shaders and expanding my knowledge in graphics programming. In addition to my technical skills, I have a strong understanding of SEO principles and how to optimize websites for search engines.

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer, and I'm excited to bring my skills and experience to any project.
