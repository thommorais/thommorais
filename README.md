Hi, I'm Thom,
Iâ€™m a Brazilian developer with a focus on front-end development, I am dedicated to optimizing website speed, search engine optimization (SEO), accessibility, and delivering an good user experience (UX). My expertise extends to React and its ecosystem, including Redux, Recoil, Framer Motion, and Next.js. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with React Native and a foundational understanding of Svelte, Electron, Wordpress, Strapi and Golang. Currently, I am exploring Three.js and GLSL, expanding my skill set in 3D graphics and visual effects.
